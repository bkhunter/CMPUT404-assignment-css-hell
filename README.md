Gutenberg changes:
====================
 * Changed the body background to look like an old scroll

 * General paragraphs now have:
    - serif font
    - size, style, weight, and height are set
    - All letters are capitalized

 * The first letter of every paragraph is set to size 200%, gold color, and given an ornate background image

 * h1,h2,h3 headers now have:
    - firebrick color (red)
    - size, weight, and height are set
    - Impact font
    - a near-black box shadow
    - a lighter black background

 * a tags (links) now have:
    - near black color initially
    - a slightly lighter black color if visited
    - an underline
    - oblique styling
    - set size
 
 * When you hover over a link, the style becomes regular, and the text colour 

 * Images are now scaled to be proportionate to the page
 * Images are given a near black border, and a firebrick box shadow

 * Thematically, I was trying to make the aesthetics a cross between an old paper scroll and a fancy document.
